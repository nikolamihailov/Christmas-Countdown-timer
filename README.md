Christmas Countdown website



I was wondering how much time is left until Christmas, my favourite holiday of the year, and then I came up with the idea to create a project about it. If the user wants, he can play Christmas music while whatching the timer. The design is responsive and built from scratch with: HTML
    CSS
    JavaScript
